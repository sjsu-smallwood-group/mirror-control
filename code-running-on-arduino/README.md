Q) How do I know if this program is doing its role in this multi-program system?

Run take-serial-input.ino on the arduino device.
Make a serial port connection
and using your keyboard in the arduino serial monitor type 1,1,1,1
This should turn the screw 1 time on X and Y axis for motor A and motor B.
